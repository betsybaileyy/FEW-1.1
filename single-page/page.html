    <h2>How Margo and I met</h2>
    <p>I was at my local animal shelter when I went to the "puppy yard" to see
        if any puppies were available for adoption. I saw the sweetest white and gold
        puppy and thought, wow this would be the perfect dog for me. However, I still 
        wasn't complteley convinced. I went inside the animal shelter and asked to look
        at kittens. I've never particualrly been a cat person, but a kitten seemed
        like it might have been a better fit for my lifestyle at the time.
    </br>
        After spending some time with the kittens I couldn't stop thinking about the 
        sweet puppy I had met outside. I went out again to spend some more time with her
        and thats when I knew, I was going to adopt her.
